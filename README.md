***  description of the project ***
  First I divided the entities
  I arranged them in folders
  added riddles from each type
  player, logic, etc.
  Then I implemented the functions for each entity
  Tests on each function
  Then I combined them in the app file

***  challenge ***
  In the measureSolveTime function, I had trouble figuring out the correct way to pass the function without executing it, since the outer function should receive it without executing it.
  I solved this by passing the function without parentheses - without the execution and an additional argument that contains the arguments needed to execute the inner function

  And the outer function executes the function with the arguments sent along with the function that needs to be executed.
